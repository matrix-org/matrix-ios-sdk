# From experimentation, the way I recommend building IPA files (as of Xcode 6 / iOS 8) is:
#   xcodebuild -archivePath foo.xcarchive archive
#   xcrun -sdk iphoneos PackageApplication -v foo.xcarchive/Products/Applications/foo.app -o `pwd`/foo.ipa
# See the accomanying buildipa.sh for a complete example in context.
# The purpose of this script is to check for the myriad symptoms of broken IPA files produced by other
# tools, as discussed further below.
