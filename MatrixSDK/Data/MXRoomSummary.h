/**
 `MXRoomSummary` exposes and caches data for a room.

 Data is updated on every incoming events in the room through the
 roomSummaryUpdateDelegate object of the MXSession instance.

 By default MXSession uses a default implementation of MXRoomSummaryUpdating, MXRoomSummaryUpdater.
 But the application is free to provide its own so that, for example, in the case
 where the room has no displayname, the app can format the display name with a
 different manner.

 At any time, the application can also change the value as long as it is done on the
 main thread.
 
 `MXRoomSummary` contains several kinds of data:

     * Room state data:
       This is data provided by room state events but it is cached to avoid to 
       recompute everything everytime from the state events.
       Ex: the displayname of the room.

     * Last message data:
       This is lastMessage property.

     * Business logic data:
       This is data that is used internally by the sdk.
 
     * Other data:
       Other information shared between the sdk and sdk user.
