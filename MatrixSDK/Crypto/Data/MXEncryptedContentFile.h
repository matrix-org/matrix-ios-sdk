/**
 `MXEncryptedContentFile` contains the encryption data required to decrypt an encrypted content.
 These data are available in an encrypted event content under the `file` or `thumbnail_file` keys.
 When the client creates an encrypted attachment, these data are returned on success (see MXEncryptedAttachment class).
 
 See below an example of these data:
    {
        "url": "mxc://â€¦",
        "key": {
            "alg": "A256CTR",

            "k": "aWF6-32KGYaC3A_FEUCk1Bt0JA37zP0wrStgmdCaW-0",
            "key_ops": ["encrypt","decrypt"],
            "kty": "oct"
        },
