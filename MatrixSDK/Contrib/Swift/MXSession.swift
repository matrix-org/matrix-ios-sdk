     If the attached MXStore does not cache data permanently, the function will begin by making
     an initialSync request to the home server to get information about the rooms the user has
     interactions with.
     Then, it will start the events streaming, a long polling connection to the home server to
     listen to new coming events.
     
     If the attached MXStore caches data permanently, the function will do an initialSync only at
     the first launch. Then, for next app launches, the SDK will load events from the MXStore and
     will resume the events streaming from where it had been stopped the time before.
