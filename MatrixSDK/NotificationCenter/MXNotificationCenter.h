 `MXNotificationCenter` manages push notifications to alert the user.

 Matrix users can choose how they want to be notified when their Matrix client receives new events.
 They define rules that are stored on their home server. 

 When the app is in background, the home server will send push notifications via APNS for events 
 that match the push rules.
 
 When the app is in foreground and the SDK is up, this will be the SDK that will notify the SDK client
 that a live event matches the push rules.

    - allow to register the device for APNS @TODO
    - retrieve push rules from the home server
    - notify the SDK client when a push rule is satified by a live event
